### Hi there 👋

I’m currently working as Machine Learning Ops Engineer. 

My past projects include [triplot](https://modeloriented.github.io/triplot/) - an R package for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence, part of [DrWhy.AI](https://github.com/ModelOriented/).

You can find more information about **triplot** here:
